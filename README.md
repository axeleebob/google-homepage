BEFORE this project
-------------------
I have completed an introduction to various core elements of HTML and CSS, nothing on JavaScript.

Although I have gone through what I imagine is 90% of the HTML and CSS that a modern website would use, I do not have the ability to recall any commands and I only have a loose understanding of the CSS grids.
